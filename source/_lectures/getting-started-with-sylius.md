### Training description

In the contemporary world, software needs more specialized features than ever. Companies growth over a specific part of data management or aimed task. Only the company that put most of their resource into some field can compete with others. In such a world, either you provide the complete toolbox or provide an easy way to extend your product. 

In Sylius we do not compete with other e-commerce software in feature lists. We want to be best in e-commerce and provide a good base for your ecosystem so you can integrate with best in the specific category with ease. Do you need a rich content editor? Do not use an e-commerce software for that, choose a solution created for this purpose like Drupal, eZ, Sulu or any other. Product Information Management? Choose Akeneo or PIM core. If you need a solid base for your solution, written with Behaviour Driven Development methodology, solid software with a high-quality codebase then Sylius is for you. 

Join me and see that e-commerce development can be easy and fun. During 8-hours workshop we will together extend the basic Sylius implementation and add an option of grouping products into bundles. What is more, we will add a possibility to put the whole bundle to cart at once. As an addition, we will discount the price of a whole bundle and create a few default ones for the shop set-up so you can show effects of your work even easier.

Workshop will be mostly code oriented. More comprehensive description of Sylius UI and setup is not included in this workshop.

After training, you should be familiar with Sylius basics and will be able to start your first e-commerce project.

Training will be done in English.

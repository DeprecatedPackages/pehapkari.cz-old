            perex: |
                Building an application upon CQRS and Event Sourcing offers three pretty nice benefits.

                1. Well structured code and business logic, separated by read and write concerns.
                2. The source of truth - A reliable and recoverable view into the past of your application state.
                3. The opportunity to answer future questions that you don't know about today.

                This talk explains the good fit of two combined application architecture approaches applied to a well known real world example. It shows how to tackle some pitfalls, gives practical advices on infrastructure and exemplifies the aforementioned benefits.
